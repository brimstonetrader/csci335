It sort of stayed on track in the Pink Floyd part, doing a relatively good job. At least it said "I don't know" when it didn't. It responded like it misheard what I said. Yelling over the crowd in the club to try to carry on a conversation with a guy who got hit by a lead pipe, and he's not even nice.

It had a human name, and pets, which is something people do. It lied a lot. It kept being inconsistent with what pets it had, and asked me the same questions multiple times. This AI will not take my job as unemployed.
